# Eaglercraft-Fabric-Server-Codespaces-Modding-Test
A test to see if Fabric mods really do work on an Eaglercraft server bc spigot does. If I'm just really wrong and its super obvious I'm not doing this right, please don't crash out on me, just leave a comment telling me whats wrong and what I should fix. Thank you! :P
